# Standards

Status: ACTIVE in Module 3. Adapt these rules to your feature and follow them.

1. **Naming.** Variables and functions use camelCase and describe what they hold or do in domain terms — `service`, `price`, `saveNotes` — not single letters or generic names like `data` or `x`.

2. **File structure.** The three concerns stay in three files: `index.html` holds structure only, `styles.css` holds presentation only, `app.js` holds behavior and data. No inline styles, and no `<script>` content in the HTML beyond the single tag that loads `app.js`.

3. **Comments.** Comments explain why code exists, never what it does line by line. A comment restating the next line in English is deleted, not written.

4. **Commit messages.** Each commit message is one imperative-mood line describing what changed and why it mattered — "Add price validation to submit handler," not "fixed stuff" or "updates."

5. **Forbidden pattern.** Never use `innerHTML` to display text a user typed. Always use `textContent`, so user input can never be interpreted as HTML or executed as a script.

6. **(HW4) SQL parameters.** User values reach SQL through `prepare(...).bind(...)`, never string concatenation or template literals. A service name is data, never part of the query.

7. **(HW4) No credentials in the repository.** Not in code, not in config, not in a context file. The wrangler login token stays in the Codespace. Database ids are addresses, not keys, and may appear in `wrangler.toml`.

8. **(HW4) Failures are shown, not thrown.** A failed request (unreachable server, 400, 500) is shown to the user on the page in plain words, and what they typed is kept. It is never left as an uncaught error in the console.

**Source of truth:** If STANDARDS.md and CLAUDE.md ever disagree, STANDARDS.md wins. It's written for a human to read and agree to first; CLAUDE.md is a restatement of the same rules for an agent, not an independent source of authority.

## Split Test

**Rule: Naming (camelCase, descriptive domain terms)**
This rule applies to every task in the project — there's no task that generates code without also naming something. It stays the same from task to task; nothing about it depends on what's currently being built. If it were missing from persistent context and only given per-task, the risk is *confusion*: without a standing convention, an agent might name things differently across sessions, and a reader stitching the file together would see inconsistent style with no way to tell if it was intentional.
**Verdict: belongs in CLAUDE.md.**

**Rule: Forbidden pattern (no innerHTML for user text)**
This also applies to every task that touches rendering, which is most of this project's tasks. It doesn't change — it's a hard security-relevant rule, not something that varies by context. If it were left out of persistent context, the risk is *poisoning*: a single generated snippet using `innerHTML` could introduce a real vulnerability, and unlike a style inconsistency, this kind of mistake compounds silently until an attacker exploits it.
**Verdict: belongs in CLAUDE.md.**

**Rule: Commit messages (imperative mood, what/why)**
This rule only applies to the narrow task of writing a commit — it has nothing to do with tasks like debugging, explaining a function, or reviewing code for a bug. It doesn't change task to task, but it's only *relevant* on a fraction of tasks. Leaving it in CLAUDE.md risks *distraction*: on every unrelated task (reading a stack trace, explaining a regex), the agent is still holding commit-formatting rules in its context that have nothing to do with the work in front of it.
**Verdict: belongs in the prompt, not CLAUDE.md.**

*Prompt snippet, to be used only when asking for a commit message:*
> "Write this commit message as one imperative-mood line describing what changed and why it mattered. Don't describe the diff mechanically — say what changed in plain terms."

## Colleague Test

Who read it: No classmate was reachable before the deadline. Simulated 
this test with Claude (Anthropic), disclosed here and in the README's 
AI Use section as a substitute for an unavailable classmate, not a 
real person's response.

What was misunderstood or asked about: The reader correctly inferred 
the file structure and security rule (rule 4), but could not tell what 
domain the app belonged to — the naming examples (service, price) hint 
at it but CLAUDE.md never states the app's purpose outright.

Revision made: Added a one-line context sentence at the top of CLAUDE.md 
stating the project is a subscription cost dashboard, so a reader (human 
or agent) doesn't have to infer the domain from variable-naming examples 
alone.
